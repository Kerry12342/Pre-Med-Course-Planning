# Pre-Med-Course-Planning

This is a course planning/management tool for pre-health students and instructors. Students will able to create a profile and add available courses to a schedule. Admins (instructors) will be able to do things like:
1. View how many students planned each course.
2. View individual student schedules and the student's academic advisor.
3. Add courses, tracks, and majors. 
4. Delete courses, tracks, majors, and students.
5. Export student schedules to CSV files.

This tool will be designed as a temporary student schedule manager for the Biology and Chemistry 
departments, as well as Courtney Hance, Hamilton College's pre-health advisor, as the school transitions to
a more robust LMS which implements some of our projects features.

This is a web-based system written primarily in javascript with a backend that accesses a remote database.
New users can get started with our project by perusing the relevant system files, such as those in
Admin_Page or Student_Page, and running the associated HTML files in the browser.
