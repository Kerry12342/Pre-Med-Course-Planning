# Pre-Med-Course-Planning

This is a course planning/management tool for pre-health students and instructors. Students will able to create a profile and add available courses to a schedule. Admins (instructors) will be able to view things like:
1. How many students planned each course
2. Individual student schedules
3. Student course conflicts and alerts
(more features planned as time permits)

This tool will be designed as a temporary student schedule manager for the Biology and Chemistry departments, as well as Courtney Hance, Hamilton College's pre-health advisor, as the school transitions to a more robust LMS which implements some of our projects features.

This is a web-based system written primarily in javascript with a backend that accesses a remote database. New users can get started with our project by perusing the relevant system files, such as those in admin_page or student_interface, and running the associated HTML files in the browser.
